TrueCommand alerts provide visual warnings for monitored systems that require attention.
These alerts are either generated by the monitored system or an alert rule created in TrueCommand.

## Viewing All Alerts



To see all alerts that TrueCommand has discovered, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **All Alerts**.
Administrator accounts can see all generated alerts.
A non-administrator account can only view alerts according to their team and user account permissions.

### Viewing Alerts by System

Alerts generated by a monitored system display in both the administrative **Systems** screen and the **Dashboard** as a number above the system icon.
To view all alerts for to a single system, go to the **Dashboard** and select a single system.

Each active and resolved alert for that system is visible in this tab.
Clicking *View alert notice details (`i`)* shows details for that alert, including the option to leave comments about the alert.

## Managing Alert Rules

Alerts in TrueCommand are generated from alert rules.
Several default rules are built into TrueCommand.
TrueCommand administrators and [team members]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/TCGettingStarted/AddUsers.md#configuring-teams" >}}) with the appropriate permissions can create new alert rules.

To view all TrueCommand alert rules, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Alert Rules**.

## Configuring Alert Services

TrueCommand uses different services to expand how alerts are communicated to individual users or administrators.
Individual user accounts can use these services to manage how that account is notified of an alert.
To configure an alert service plugin, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **Alert Services**.

### Pager Duty

For example to configure Pager Dute, Open the **Configure Plugin** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> for PagerDuty.  In the
*Authtoken* section, enter your **Service Integration Key from PagerDuty**.  If you have an active subscription with PagerDuty, this key should be available to you. 
Enter a *Title for incident reports* if desired. Click *TEST*.

![AlertServicesPagerDutyOptions](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/AlertServicesPagerDutyOptions.png "Alert Services: Pager Duty options")

Login to your PagerDuty account and check for open incidents.
There you should see the triggered test alert from TrueCommand.
If no test alert was received, check the **Service Integration Key from PagerDuty** for accuracy in the plugin configuration section of the alert service.
