A "scrub" is when ZFS scans the data on a pool.
Scrubs identify data integrity problems, detect silent data corruptions caused by transient hardware issues, and provide early disk failure alerts.

## Default Scrub Tasks

By default, TrueNAS creates a scrub task when you create a new pool.
The default schedule for a scrub is to run every Sunday at 12:00 AM.
To edit the default scrub, go to **Tasks > Scrub Tasks**, click <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i>, and *EDIT*.

## Creating New Scrub Tasks

A data [pool]({{< relref "PoolCreate.md" >}}) must exist before creating a scrub task.

To create a scrub task for a pool, go to **Tasks > Scrub Tasks** and click *ADD*.
