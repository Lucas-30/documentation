TrueNAS can send, receive, or synchronize data with a Cloud Storage provider.
Cloud Sync tasks allow for single time transfers or recurring transfers on a schedule, and are an effective method to back up data to a remote location.

{{< hint warning >}}
Using the Cloud means that data can go to a third party commercial vendor not directly affiliated with iXsystems.
Please investigate and fully understand that vendorâ€™s pricing policies and services before creating any Cloud Sync task.
iXsystems is not responsible for any charges incurred from the use of third party vendors with the Cloud Sync feature.
{{< /hint >}}

TrueNAS supports major providers like Amazon S3, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, along with a variety of other vendors.
To see the full list of supported vendors, go to **System > Cloud Credentials > Add** and open the *Provider* dropdown.

## Requirements

* All system [Storage](/core/storage/) must be configured and ready to receive or send data.
* A Cloud Storage provider account and a cloud storage location must be available, like an Amazon S3 bucket.
* Cloud Storage account credentials must be saved to **System > Cloud Credentials** before creating the sync task.
  See [Cloud Credentials](/core/system/cloudcredentials/) for specific instructions.

## Creating a Cloud Sync Task

Go to **Tasks > Cloud Sync Tasks** and click *Add*.

![TasksCloudSyncAdd](/images/CORE/12.0/TasksCloudSyncAdd.png "Creating a Cloud Sync Task")

Give the task a memorable *Description* and select an existing cloud *Credential*.
TrueNAS connects to the chosen Cloud Storage Provider and shows the available storage locations.
Decide if data is transferring to (*PUSH*) or from (*PULL*) the Cloud Storage location (**Remote**).
Choose a *Transfer Mode*:

{{< tabs "Transfer Modes" >}}
{{< tab "Sync" >}}
*Sync* keeps all the files identical between the two storage locations.
If the sync encounters an error, files are not deleted in the destination.
This includes a common error when the [Dropbox copyright detector](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/30/how-dropbox-knows-when-youre-sharing-copyrighted-stuff-without-actually-looking-at-your-stuff/) flags a file as copyrighted.

Note that syncing to a Backblaze B2 bucket does not delete files from the bucket, even when those files have been deleted locally.
Instead, files are tagged with a version number or moved to a hidden state.
To automatically delete old or unwanted files from the bucket, adjust the [Backblaze B2 Lifecycle Rules](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-b2-lifecycle-rules/).

Files stored in Amazon S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive cannot be deleted by a sync.
These files must first be restored by another means, like the [Amazon S3 console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html).
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Copy" >}}
*Copy* duplicates each source file into the destination, _overwriting_ any files in the destination that have the same name as the source.
Copying is the least potentially destructive option.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Move" >}}
*Move* transfers the files from the source to the destination and _deletes_ the original source files.
Files with the same names on the destination are overwritten.

Next, **Control** when the task runs by defining a *Schedule*.
When a specific *Schedule* is required, choose *Custom* and use the **Advanced Scheduler**.

{{< expand "Advanced Scheduler" "v" >}}
{{< include file="static/includes/AdvancedScheduler.md.part" markdown="true" >}}
{{< /expand >}}

Unsetting *Enable* makes the configuration available without allowing the *Schedule* to run the task.
To manually activate a saved task, go to **Tasks > Cloud Sync Tasks**, click <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i> to expand a task, and click *RUN NOW*.

The remaining options allow tuning the task to your specific requirements.

{{< expand "Specific Options" "v" >}}
{{< include file="static/includes/TasksCloudSyncAddFields.md.part" markdown="true" >}}

### Scripting and Environment Variables

Advanced users can write scripts that run immediately *before* or *after* the Cloud Sync task.
The **Post-script** field is only run when the Cloud Sync task successfully completes.
You can pass a variety of task environment variables into the **Pre-** and **Post-** script fields:

* CLOUD_SYNC_ID
* CLOUD_SYNC_DESCRIPTION
* CLOUD_SYNC_DIRECTION
* CLOUD_SYNC_TRANSFER_MODE
* CLOUD_SYNC_ENCRYPTION
* CLOUD_SYNC_FILENAME_ENCRYPTION
* CLOUD_SYNC_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
* CLOUD_SYNC_ENCRYPTION_SALT
* CLOUD_SYNC_SNAPSHOT

There also are provider-specific variables like CLOUD_SYNC_CLIENT_ID or CLOUD_SYNC_TOKEN or CLOUD_SYNC_CHUNK_SIZE

Remote storage settings:
* CLOUD_SYNC_BUCKET
* CLOUD_SYNC_FOLDER

Local storage settings:
* CLOUD_SYNC_PATH

### Testing Settings

Test the settings before saving by clicking *DRY RUN*.
TrueNAS connects to the Cloud Storage Provider and simulates a file transfer.
No data is actually sent or received.
A dialog shows the test status and allows downloading the task logs.

![TasksCloudsyncAddGoogledriveDryrun](/images/CORE/12.0/TasksCloudsyncAddGoogledriveDryrun.png "Example: Google Drive Test")

## Cloud Sync Behavior

Saved tasks are activated according to their schedule or by clicking **RUN NOW**.
An in-progress cloud sync must finish before another can begin.
Stopping an in-progress task cancels the file transfer and requires starting the file transfer over.

To view logs about a running or the most recent run of a task, click the task status.

## Cloud Sync Restore

To quickly create a new Cloud Sync that uses the same options but reverses the data transfer, expand (<i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>) an existing Cloud Sync and click *RESTORE*.

![TasksCloudSyncRestore](/images/CORE/12.0/TasksCloudSyncRestore.png "Cloud Sync Restore")

Enter a new *Description* for this reversed task and define the path to a storage location for the transferred data.

The restored cloud sync is saved as another entry in **Tasks > Cloud Sync Tasks**.
