Google Drive and G Suite are widely used to create and share documents, spreadsheets, and presentations with team members. While cloud-based tools have inherent backups and replications included by the cloud provider, certain users may require additional backup or archive capabilities. For example, companies using G Suite for important work may need to keep records for years, potentially beyond the scope of the G Suite subscription. TrueNAS can easily back up Google Drive using its built-in cloud sync.


## Setting up Google Drive credentials

Go to **System > Cloud Credentials** and click *ADD*.
Name the Credential and select *Google Drive* as the Provider. 
Click *LOGIN TO PROVIDER* and log in with the appropriate Google user account.

Google will request permission to access all the Google Drive files for the FreeNAS device.

Allow access and the appropriate access key will generate in the FreeNAS access token. You may assign a Team ID if necessary. 

Click *VERIFY CREDENTIAL* and wait for it to verify.

 Once successful, click *SUBMIT*. The new cloud credentials will be visible in the web interface.

### Set the cloud sync task

Go to **Tasks > Cloud Sync Tasks** and set the backup time frame, frequency, and folders â€“ both the cloud-based folder and TrueNAS dataset. 
Set whether the synchronization should sync all changes, copy new files, or move files. 
Files are removed from the cloud source or TrueNAS source depending on if the task is set to push or pull.
Add a description for the task and select the cloud credentials.
Choose the appropriate cloud folder target and TrueNAS storage location.

Select the file transfer mode: 

+ **Sync**: Keep files newly created or deleted the same.
+ **Copy**: Copy new files to the appropriate target (i.e., TrueNAS pulls files from Google Drive or pushes files to Google Drive).
+ **Move**: Copy files to the target and then delete them from the source. Using Move, users can set a folder in Google Drive for archival, and move older documents to that folder from their Drive account. Those files would then automatically get backed up to their TrueNAS storage.

Once you create the task, attempt a Dry Run.

If the Dry Run succeeds, click *SAVE* to save the task.

![CloudSyncTaskNew](/images/CORE/12.0/CloudSyncTaskNew.png "Cloud Sync Task New")

Expand the section down to see the options for the task.

![CloudSyncTaskNewExpanded](/images/CORE/12.0/CloudSyncTaskNewExpanded.png "Cloud Sync Task New Expanded")

Clicking *RUN NOW* will prompt the task to start immediately.

![CloudSyncTaskStarted](/images/CORE/12.0/CloudSyncTaskStarted.png "Cloud Sync Task Started")

![CloudSyncTaskRunning](/images/CORE/12.0/CloudSyncTaskRunning.png "Cloud Sync Task Running")

The web interface will show the status as *RUNNING* and *SUCCESS* upon completion. Details can be accessed via the *Task Manager* icon in the upper right-hand corner.  While the task is running, clicking on the *RUNNING* button will reveal a popup log.

Once the sync reports a *SUCCESS* status, you can verify it by opening the folder on another computer if it is a share, through SSH access, or by checking the destination directory through the TrueNAS CLI.
