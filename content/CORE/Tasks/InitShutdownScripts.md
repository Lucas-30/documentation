{{< expand "Can I use a path for the Command?" "v" >}}
You can also include the full path to a command in the entry.
Scheduled commands must be in the default path.
The path can be tested with `which {COMMAND}` in the **Shell**.
When available, the path to the command is shown:

```
[root@freenas ~]# which ls
/bin/ls
```
