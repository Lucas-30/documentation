[SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1157) monitors network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention.

To configure SNMP, go to the **Services** page, find the **SNMP** entry, and click the <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure"></i>.

When starting the SNMP service, port *UDP 161* listens for SNMP requests.

## Management Information Bases (MIBs)

Available Management Information Bases (MIBs) are located in <file>/usr/local/share/snmp/mibs</file>.
This directory contains many files being routinely added or removed from the directory.
Check the directory on your system by clicking **Shell** and entering `ls /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs`.
Here is a sample of the directory contents:
