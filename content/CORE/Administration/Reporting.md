## Reporting General Settings

TrueNAS has a built in reporting engine that gives helpful graphs and information about the system.
TrueNAS uses [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/ "Graphite Homepage") for metric gathering and visualizations.
Some general settings can be found in **System > Reporting**.

![SystemReporting](/images/CORE/12.0/SystemReporting.png "Reporting Options")

When *Report CPU usage in percent* is set, it simply reports the CPU usage in percent rather than units of kernel time. When *Graphite Separate Instances* is set, it sends the *plugin instance* and *type instance* to Graphite as separate path components: *host.cpu.0.cpu.idle*. When it is not set, the *plugin* and *plugin instance* as one path component and *type* and *type instance* as another component: *host.cpu-0.cpu-idle*.

A *Remote Graphite Server Hostname* can be typed in the respective field. The *Graph Age in Months* field is used to set the maximum number of months a graphis stored. The *Number of Graph points* field is used to set the number of points for each hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly graph.  

{{< hint warning >}}
Report history is cleared when CPU reporting, Graph Age, or Graph Points are changed.

## Graphs

TrueNAS uses [collectd](https://collectd.org/) to provide reporting statistics. A comprehensive list of graphs and reporting are found in **Reporting**. Change the category of reporting by selecting an option of the drop-down. Graphs can be interacted with by clicking and dragging on a certain range, or by clicking <i class="fa fa-search-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i>, <i class="fa fa-search-minus" aria-hidden="true"></i>, <i class="fa fa-forward" aria-hidden="true" title="Forward"></i>, <i class="fa fa-backward" aria-hidden="true" title="Backward"></i>.

Below is a summary of what each page of graphs displays:

{{< tabs "Graphs Pages" >}}
{{< tab "CPU" >}}
[CPU](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:CPU) shows the amount of time spent by the CPU in various states such as executing user code, executing system code, and being idle.
Graphs of short-, mid-, and long-term load are shown, along with CPU temperature graphs.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Disk" >}}
[Disk](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Disk) shows read and write statistics on I/O, percent busy, latency, operations per second, pending I/O requests, and disk temperature.
Choose the *DEVICES* and *METRICS* to view the selected metrics for the chosen devices.
{{< hint warning >}}
Temperature monitoring for the disk is disabled if *HDD Standby* is enabled on the disk.
{{< /hint >}}

![ReportingDisksTab](/images/CORE/12.0/ReportingDisksTab.png "Disks Reporting")

The default view shows a temperature graph of the first disk. To see the temperature graphs of more disks, select them from the *DEVICES* drop-down. To view other metrics such as *Disk I/O* and *Disk Latency*, select them from the *METRICS* drop-down.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Memory" >}}
[Memory](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Memory) displays memory usage.
[Swap](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Swap) displays the amount of free and used swap space.

![ReportingMemoryTab](/images/CORE/12.0/ReportingMemoryTab.png "Memory Reporting")

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Network" >}}
[Network](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Interface) shows received and transmitted traffic in megabytes per second for each configured interface.

![ReportingNetworkTab](/images/CORE/12.0/ReportingNetworkTab.png "Network Reporting")

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "NFS" >}}
[NFS](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:NFS) shows information about the number of procedure calls for each procedure and whether the system is a server or client.

![ReportingNFSTab](/images/CORE/12.0/ReportingNFSTab.png "NFS Reporting")

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Partition" >}}
[Partition](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:DF) displays free, used, and reserved space for each pool and dataset. However, the disk space used by an individual zvol is not displayed as it is a block device.

![ReportingPartitionTab](/images/CORE/12.0/ReportingPartitionTab.png "Partition Reporting")

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "System" >}}
[System](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Processes) displays the number of processes.
It is grouped by state.

![ReportingSystemTab](/images/CORE/12.0/ReportingSystemTab.png "System Reporting")

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Target" >}}
*Target* shows bandwidth statistics for iSCSI ports.

![ReportingTargetTab](/images/CORE/12.0/ReportingTargetTab.png "iSCSI Target Reporting")

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "UPS" >}}
[UPS](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:NUT) displays statistics about an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) using [Network UPS tools](https://networkupstools.org/).
Statistics include voltages, currents, power, frequencies, load, and temperatures.

![ReportingUPSTab](/images/CORE/12.0/ReportingUPSTab.png "UPS Reporting")

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "ZFS" >}}
[ZFS](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:ZFS_ARC) shows compressed physical ARC size, hit ratio, demand data, demand metadata, and prefetch data.

Reporting data is saved to permit viewing and monitoring usage trends over time.
This data is preserved across system upgrades and restarts.

Data files are saved in <file>/var/db/collectd/rrd/</file>.

{{< hint warning >}}
Reporting data is frequently written and should not be stored on the boot pool or operating system device.
